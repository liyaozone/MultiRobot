This version includes link_coop.launch and stairs_cylinder.ttt

Have done:
1.Calculating the angle between two robots and relating this angle with the velocity of legs to maintain two robots in a line.
2.Adding a cylinder at the front of the first robot to make it easier to be pushed to the stairs.

Todo:
1.The legs always get stuck by the stairs. [Video 1]
2.My code has published the velocity to the robots but the legs move in the wrong velocity. [Video 2]
	When one leg moves much faster than another one, it seems that the velocity of legs is not correct.
	
	At first, the velocity of left is 3.6 and the velocity of right is 0.6
	Then, the velocty of left is 3.6 and the velocity of right is 3.6
	But in the video, the velocity of left leg is not the same.
