This version includes link_coop.launch and stairs_cylinder.ttt

Have done:
1.Calculating the angle between two robots and relating this angle with the velocity of legs to maintain two robots in a line.
2.Adding a cylinder at the front of the first robot to make it easier to be pushed to the stairs.

Todo:
1.The legs always get stuck by the stairs.
2.My code has published the velocity to the robots but the legs move in the wrong velocity.
